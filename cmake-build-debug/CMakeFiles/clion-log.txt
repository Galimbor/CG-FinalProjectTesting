CMake Warning (dev) at /etc/clion-2021.1.1/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.19/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:426 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (rt) does
  not match the name of the calling package (RT).  This can lead to problems
  in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables (e.g.,
  `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  external/assimp-5.0.1/cmake-modules/FindRT.cmake:19 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  external/assimp-5.0.1/code/CMakeLists.txt:1013 (FIND_PACKAGE)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
